Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player. 
That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.

##my solution : 1st try

select *, coalesce(Lag(games_played,1) OVER (partition by player_id ORDER BY event_date),0) as previous,
games_played+coalesce(LAG(games_played,1) OVER (partition by player_id ORDER BY event_date),0) as total
from activity


## actual solution:

select t1.player_id, t1.event_date, sum(t2.games_played) as games_played_so_far
from Activity as t1 inner join Activity as t2
on t1.player_id = t2.player_id
where t1.event_date >= t2.event_date
group by t1.player_id, t1.event_date
